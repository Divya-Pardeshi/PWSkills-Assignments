    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

A class serves as a blueprint from which individual objects can be created.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. It provides data hiding and allows objects to control access to their internal state. Encapsulation helps achieve data abstraction and protects the internal details of an object from external interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. It enables code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. The derived class (subclass) inherits the properties of the base class (superclass) and can extend or modify its behavior. Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method in different ways. It allows objects to exhibit different behaviors based on their data type or class hierarchy. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). Polymorphism enhances code flexibility and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining interfaces and hiding implementation details. Abstraction allows programmers to create abstract classes and interfaces that provide a high-level view of the system, allowing for easy maintenance and code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP provide a strong foundation for designing modular, reusable, and extensible code. They promote code flexibility, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier to develop and manage complex software systems."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is a convention used to refer to the instance of a class within the class's methods. It acts as a reference to the object itself. The use of `self` allows you to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the object within its own scope.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here are a few reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",

    "1. Instance-specific access: `self` allows you to access and modify the attributes and methods of a specific instance of a class. Each object created from the class has its own set of attributes, and `self` ensures that you can operate on the correct instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Differentiating between instance and local variables: By using `self`, you can differentiate between instance variables (attributes) and local variables within a method. It clarifies that you are working with attributes of the object rather than just local variables in that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method chaining: `self` enables method chaining, which means you can call multiple methods on the same object in a sequential manner. Each method returns `self`, allowing you to call the next method on the resulting object. This facilitates writing concise and expressive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clarity and readability: The use of `self` makes the code more readable and self-explanatory. It clearly indicates that you are referring to the object itself, enhancing the understanding of the code for both developers and readers.\n",

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called the \"derived class\" or \"subclass,\" and the class being inherited from is called the \"base class,\" \"parent class,\" or \"superclass.\" Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and supports the principle of hierarchical classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance:\n",
    "   In single inheritance, a derived class inherits properties and methods from a single base class. It forms a one-to-one parent-child relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Vehicle:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "       def drive(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Driving\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "       def honk(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Honking\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
    "   my_car.drive()   # Output: Driving\n",
    "   my_car.honk()    # Output: Honking\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "   Multiple inheritance allows a derived class to inherit properties and methods from multiple base classes. It forms a multiple parent-child relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def eat(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Eating\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Flyable:\n",
    "       def fly(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Flying\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Bird(Animal, Flyable):\n",
    "       def chirp(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Chirping\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_bird = Bird()\n",
    "   my_bird.eat()    # Output: Eating\n",
    "   my_bird.fly()    # Output: Flying\n",
    "   my_bird.chirp()  # Output: Chirping\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance:\n",
    "   Multilevel inheritance involves creating a derived class from another derived class. It forms a hierarchy of parent-child relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def eat(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Eating\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Mammal(Animal):\n",
    "       def sleep(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Sleeping\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Mammal):\n",
    "       def bark(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Barking\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_dog = Dog()\n",
    "   my_dog.eat()     # Output: Eating\n",
    "   my_dog.sleep()   # Output: Sleeping\n",
    "   my_dog.bark()    # Output: Barking\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance:\n",
    "   Hierarchical inheritance involves creating multiple derived classes from a single base class. It forms a one-to-many parent-child relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Shape:\n",
    "       def draw(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Drawing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "       def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Calculating Circle's area\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "       def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Calculating Rectangle's area\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_circle = Circle()\n",
    "   my_circle.draw()           # Output: Drawing\n",
    "   my_circle.calculate_area() # Output: Calculating Circle's area\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_rectangle = Rectangle()\n",
    "   my_rectangle.draw()           # Output: Drawing\n",
    "   my_rectangle.calculate_area() # Output: Calculating Rectangle's area\n",
