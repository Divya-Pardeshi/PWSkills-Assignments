    "**Ans**\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n",

    "***SQL vs NoSQL Databases***\n",
    "\n",
    "***SQL Databases:***\n",
    "* Relational: SQL databases are relational databases, meaning they store data in tables that are related to each other.\n",
    "* Schema-Based: They use a predefined schema to organize data into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "* Complex Queries: Suitable for complex queries and transactions.\n",
    "* ACID Properties: Ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which guarantee reliable transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NoSQL Databases:***\n",
    "* Non-Relational: NoSQL databases are non-relational or distributed databases, meaning they do not use tables to store data.\n",
    "* Schema-Free: They do not require a fixed schema and can store data in various formats such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-columns.\n",
    "* Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "* Horizontal Scaling: Designed for horizontal scaling and large-scale data distribution.\n",
    "* Flexibility: Provide flexibility in data modeling and are optimized for specific use cases like big data, real-time web applications, and more.\t"
