Furthermore, we represent them by writing the elements inside the parenthesis separated by commas. We can also define tuples as lists that we cannot change. Therefore, we can call them immutable tuples. Hence, tuples are not modifiable in nature. These immutable tuples are a kind of group data type. Moreover, we access elements by using the index starting from zero."

    "In Python, tuples have two built-in methods:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "In the above example, `count(2)` returns the number of occurrences of the value `2` in the tuple.\n",

    "In the above example, `index(3)` returns the index of the first occurrence of the value `3` in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have only these two built-in methods compared to lists for a specific reason: immutability. Tuples are designed to be immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation. As a result, methods that would modify the tuple, such as `append`, `insert`, or `remove`, are not included in the tuple's built-in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, on the other hand, are mutable, allowing elements to be added, removed, or modified. Therefore, lists have a richer set of built-in methods that support these operations, including `append`, `insert`, `remove`, `extend`, and more.\n",

    "The `union()` and `update()` methods in Python are used with sets to perform operations that combine multiple sets together. However, there is a difference in how they handle the resulting set and the original set. Let's explain each method and provide examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `union()` method:\n",
    "The `union()` method returns a new set that contains all the unique elements from the original set as well as another set or iterable. It does not modify the original set. If there are duplicate elements, they will be included only once in the resulting set.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. `update()` method:\n",
    "The `update()` method modifies the original set by adding all the unique elements from another set or iterable into it. It performs an in-place update of the set and does not return a new set.\n",
